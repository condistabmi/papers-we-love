## What is Cuts IMG?
 
Cuts IMG is a mod created by The Eddo, a GTA modder who specializes in improving the visual aspects of the game. Cuts IMG replaces the original cutscene files with new ones that have higher resolution, better textures, and smoother animations. Cuts IMG also fixes some bugs and glitches that occur in the original cutscenes, such as missing objects, clipping issues, and incorrect lighting.
 
Cuts IMG is compatible with both the original GTA SA and the remastered version. It also works with other mods that modify the game files, such as SA-MP, Cleo, or ENB Series. However, you should always backup your game files before installing any mod, just in case something goes wrong.
