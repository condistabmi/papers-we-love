Unfortunately, most of the sites that claim to be ExtraTorrent are fake, malicious, or unreliable. Some of them may even infect your device with malware, spyware, or ransomware. Therefore, it is very important to be careful when you try to download ExtraTorrent 2019 latest version from the internet. In this article, we will show you how to do it safely and easily, using a trusted VPN service and a reliable torrent client.
 
## Why You Need a VPN to Download ExtraTorrent 2019 Latest Version
 
A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server in another location. This way, you can hide your IP address and location from anyone who might be monitoring your online activity, such as your ISP, government agencies, hackers, or copyright holders.
 
A VPN can help you download ExtraTorrent 2019 latest version for several reasons:
 
- It can bypass geo-restrictions and censorship that may prevent you from accessing torrent sites in your region.
- It can protect your privacy and anonymity while you download torrents, preventing anyone from tracking your downloads or sending you legal notices.
- It can enhance your security and prevent malware infections by blocking malicious ads, pop-ups, and redirects that may appear on torrent sites.
- It can improve your download speed and performance by avoiding bandwidth throttling and congestion that may occur when your ISP detects torrenting activity.

However, not all VPNs are suitable for torrenting. Some of them may keep logs of your activity, leak your IP address, or limit your bandwidth. Therefore, you need to choose a VPN that offers the following features:

- A strict no-logs policy that ensures your data is not stored or shared with anyone.
- A large network of servers in different countries that allows you to access any torrent site you want.
- A high level of encryption and security protocols that protects your data from hackers and snoopers.
- A kill switch and DNS leak protection that prevents your IP address from being exposed if the VPN connection drops.
- A fast and reliable connection that supports unlimited bandwidth and P2P traffic.

One of the best VPNs for torrenting is **NordVPN**. It has over 5,000 servers in 60 countries, including many optimized for P2P. It uses AES-256 encryption and OpenVPN protocol to secure your data. It has a strict no-logs policy and an automatic kill switch. It also offers a CyberSec feature that blocks ads and malware on torrent sites. It has a 30-day money-back guarantee and a 24/7 customer support service.
