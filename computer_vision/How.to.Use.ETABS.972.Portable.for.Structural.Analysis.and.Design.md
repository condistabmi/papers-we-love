ETABS 9.7.2 is an older version of the software that was released in 2010. It has some limitations and bugs compared to the newer versions, but it is still widely used by engineers and students who need a simple and reliable tool for their projects.
 
One of the advantages of ETABS 9.7.2 is that it can run as a portable application, without the need for installation or activation. This means that you can use it on any Windows computer, even if you don't have administrator rights or internet access. You can also carry it on a USB flash drive or an external hard drive and use it on different machines.
 
To use ETABS 9.7.2 portable, you need to download a zip file that contains the executable file and the necessary libraries and files. You can find this file on various websites, such as [^1^] or [^2^]. However, you should be careful about the source of the file, as some websites may contain viruses or malware that can harm your computer.
 
After downloading the zip file, you need to extract it to a folder of your choice. Then, you can run the ETABS.exe file to launch the software. You will see a splash screen and then the main interface of ETABS 9.7.2.
 
You can now create a new model or open an existing one from the File menu. You can also import or export data from other software, such as AutoCAD, SAP2000, SAFE, etc. You can define the geometry, materials, loads, and boundary conditions of your structure using the graphical user interface or the input file editor. You can then perform the analysis and design of your structure using the Analysis menu or the Design menu.
 
ETABS 9.7.2 portable has some features that are not available in the newer versions, such as the ability to generate wind loads according to ASCE 7-05 or UBC 97 codes, or the ability to design composite beams according to AISC LRFD code. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as the lack of support for Eurocode or ACI 318-14 codes, or the inability to perform pushover analysis or buckling analysis.
 
Therefore, you should use ETABS 9.7.2 portable with caution and check your results with other sources or methods. You should also update your software to the latest version if possible, as it will provide you with more features, stability, and accuracy.
